[![Build Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/54fedaf45ab6cc135296cb36/badge?branchName=develop)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/54fedaf45ab6cc135296cb36/builds/latest)

The idea is to have multiple calendar designs with different formats,
localized text, custom colors, etc. and be able to create beautiful pdfs
to use on Ilustrator, Coreldraw, Photoshop or where you need it
